HI! My name is **Tyler Capstick**. I am an aspiring JR Full-Stack developer. I am currently attending _Savvy Coders_. I have loved technology ever since I was a child and I am looking forward to developing websites and apps. After graduating highschool I didn't know exactly which degree I wanted to pursue so I ended up pursuing the same type of degree my friends were going towards. During Covid I decided to switch up my career path towards something I have always loved which is technology.

### Course Goals!
1. I want to learn how to use JAVASCRIPT to develop websites&Apps!
2. I would **LOVE** to lane a JR. Developer job to better provide for my family!
3. I would like to have connections for networking to market myself.
